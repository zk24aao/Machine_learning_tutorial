# Understanding Multilayer Perceptrons: Depth vs. Width
_
OVERVIEW_
This repository contains in depth tutorial on the impact of depth and width in Multilayer Perceptrons(MLP). The tutorial demonstrates how these choices affect the model performance using MNIST dataset for digit classification.

Repository Contents
1.notebook.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook implementing MLP's with varying depths and widths
2.Tutorial.pdf -> Tutorial explaining what is MLP and the result of different architectures.
3.README.md -> Documentation and guidelines for using this repository.

**Installation and Setup**

Ensure you have the following installation done :

* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook/ Colabnotebook
* Tensorflow /Keras
* Matplotlib and Numpy

**Training  Details :**
The tutorial explores :
                  * **Effect of depth**: How increasing the number of layers impacts model learning.
                  * **Effect of Width:** How changing the number of neurons per layer influences performance.
                 * **Balancing Complexity:**  Understanding overfitting and underfitting when adjusting depth and width.
